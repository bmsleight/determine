<h2>Welcome</h2>
<h4>What is determine ?</h4>
<p>A website where traffic signal timing diagrams can be produced.</p> 
<p><i><b>Generate traffic signal timing diagrams to determine green running times.</b></i></p>

<h4>Examples</h4>
<p>Some time a picture (or even a diagram) is worth a thousand words, below a few example reports (pdf files) :-</p>
<ul>
<li><a href=http://www.determine.org.uk/examples/01234-a-nice-test-1.pdf>Very basic example site - full report;</a></li>
<li>Complex site - normal report.</li>
</ul>

<h4>How ?</h4>
<p>By entering basic detail of a traffic signal site. Such as :-</p>
<ul>
<li>Site Address (used in the title of the diagrams);</li>
<li>Phases;</li>
<li>Stage names and phases in stages;</li>
<li>Intergreens;</li>
<li>Phase delays (only phase delay leaving at this point);</li>
<li>Diagrams</li>
</ul>
<p>Once all detials of the site hads been entered a report can be generated.</p>
<h4>What Kind of Reports are produced ?</h4>
<p>The report is centered around the one or more diagrams requested. At the moment the entering of a required diagram is simplistic. The cycle time is entered followed by a number of forced stage movements  to occur during the cycle. A minimum cycle time can be generated by using a cycle time of 0, together with the stage moves in order.<p>
<p>There are three type of reported that can be generated:-</p>
<ul>
<li>Simple - Just the diagrams are produced.</li>
<li>Normal - The diagrams, followed by details of the site configuration. </li>
<li>Full - The diagrams, followed by details of the site configuration, followed by the report in xml format. The xml format report details for each diagram, for each second, for status of each phase in detail. </li>
</ul>
